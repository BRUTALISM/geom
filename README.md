# thi.ng/geom

Comprehensive geometry toolkit for Clojure/ClojureScript developed in a
literate programming style.

Currently ALPHA quality, pre-release software. Further breaking API
changes forthcoming...

## Description & usage

See [index.org](src/index.org) for details. Also please note, the [dev branch](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/tree/develop) is (as one might expect) often quite a bit ahead of master and I'm aiming to push at least weekly snapshots of all modules to ~~[clojars.org](http://clojars.org)~~ the dev.thi.ng repository...

## Current Leiningen coordinates

```clojure
[thi.ng/geom "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

Until Clojars deploys are fixed again, current versions are only available from our own repo. Therefore, please add the following to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:repositories [["thing" "http://dev.thi.ng/repo/"]]
```
