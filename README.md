# thi.ng/geom

Comprehensive geometry toolkit for Clojure/ClojureScript developed in a
literate programming style.

Currently ALPHA quality, pre-release software. Further breaking API
changes forthcoming...

## Description & usage

See [index.org](src/index.org) for details. Also please note, the [dev branch](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/tree/develop) is (as one might expect) quite a bit ahead of master and I'm aiming to push at least weekly snapshots of all modules to [clojars.org](http://clojars.org).
