# thi.ng/geom

![SVO mesh created with geom-voxel module](assets/svo-d7.jpg)

Comprehensive and modular geometry toolkit for Clojure/ClojureScript
developed in a literate programming style.

Currently BETA quality, pre-release software. The libraries have been
used in production for several projects, but further breaking API
changes are still forthcoming...

## Description & usage

See [index.org](src/index.org) for details. Also please note, the
[dev branch](https://github.com/thi-ng/geom/tree/develop) is (as one
might expect) often quite a bit ahead of master and I'm aiming to push
at least weekly snapshots of all modules to
[clojars.org](http://clojars.org)...

## Current Leiningen coordinates

```clj
[thi.ng/geom "0.0.743"]
